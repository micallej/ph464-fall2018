Project One: a simple data analyiss program and using git.

The goal of the first project is to write a complete program to read in x-y data from a file and calculate least squares regression to this data. We will first do a linear regression using a parabolic model. Later we will add a nonlinear regression using a solid state equation of state called the Murnaghan equation.

While developing your program you are tracking your development using git.
Commit your project apporixmately after you have achieved the following milestones.

Before you start do these 2 steps.
1- Initialize your name and email for git (see cheat sheet):

git config --global user.name "[name]"
git config --global user.email "[email address]"

2- Copy the project directory projects/one into the student subdirectory with your initial added like

cp -r projects/one students/one-gs

Work and make changes in this directory only. 

1 - Read the data from file and create x and y data.
2 - Add a plot of your data.
3 - Perform a linear regression to a parabolic function using for example
    (numpy/polyfit)
    Update your graph.
    Extract the minimum and the curvature from your linear regression.
    
4 - Observe the performance of your regression and think about the validity of  a quadratic approximation. Improve your linear regression by restricting your data to a few points (how many is reasonable?) around the minimum.

Optional:

5 - Perform a nonlinear regression to the Murnaghan equation of state
    (wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murnaghan_equation_of_state)
    using for example (numpy/curvefit) Update your graph.
